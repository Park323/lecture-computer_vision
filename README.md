# 2021-Fall 컴퓨터비전

### Course Overview

In this course, students will understand __image formation, representation, and processing__\
and learn __traditional techniques and deep learning based methods__ to handle various computer vision related problems. \
General processing methods such as feature extraction from 2D or 3D images and 3D reconstruction problems will also be covered. \
Students will learn how to solve representative computer vision problems through a number of programming projects.

### Project 1 : Image Rotation
a. Rotate an image by 45 degrees with forward method\
b. Rotate an image by 45 degrees with backward method\
c. Compare nearest neighbor interpolation with bilinear interpolation method.
